# Getting started
You only need to be here if you have NEVER setup your machine to execute or build .net

While there are many tools, many languages, many environments, and a million different ways to do the same thing in this field, I'm only going to focus our efforts on .Net 3 and Visual Studio Code.

Lets start:
1. Open a console window and enter *dotnet --version*
  1. If you have dotnet installed, you should get a version number returned. If you get a return like *3.0.100* move on
  1. If you don't get a number, or if you get a number lower than 3, or any other response, you need to install [.Net Core 3 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
